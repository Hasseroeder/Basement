        <h1> Pet Exp</h1>
        <p> Pet experience is gained by a couple of methods, including battling, hunting, and also just by doing absolutely nothing. <br>
            I won't be talking about Profile exp here, since I honestly just find that boring as fuck.<br><br>
            
            You'll have 2 or 3 teams in your <code class="discord-code">owotm</code>, which we call "Primary", "Secondary", and "Tertiary", the last of which is exclusive to uncommon and above Patreons. 
            Your Primary team is the selected one, and the others are to the right of this, cycling back to the start after the third slot.
            Generally speaking, your Primary gains full exp, Secondary gains half exp and <owo-img style="width:1rem; margin-bottom: -0.1rem;">patreon</owo-img> Tertiary gains no exp.<br><br>
            
            But exp doesn't stack if you have Pets on both your Primary & Secondary, so it generally doesn't make much sense to share pets between these teams.
            Stacking Pets or even entire Teams in the Tertiary team is quite common though, as there's no reason not to, and you're getting extra Blitz performance for free.<br><br>

            The basic exp needed per level up is: <code class="discord-code">1000 + level^4</code>
        </p>
        <h2 style="margin-top:2rem;"> Battle Exp <owo-img style="width:1.7rem; margin-bottom: -0.3rem;">crossed-swords</owo-img>
</h2>
        <p>
        
            Your main team gains 200/100/50 Exp on a Win/Tie/Loss. <br>
            <span style="margin-bottom:0.7rem; display: inline-block;">And your secondary team passively gains 100/50/25 Exp for the same.</span><br>
            
            This also happens when others encounter you in random battles, and not just when you grind <code class="discord-code">owob</code> yourself. Your streaks are unaffected by these battles though, and due to how rarely you're encountered by random people, the amount of gained exp is miniscule compared to grinding <code class="discord-code">owob</code> yourself. We typically call this "Blitz" exp, because it's more noticeable when your blitz team kills some high level player and you gain a bunch of Bonus exp.<br> <br>
        </p>  
        <h3 style="margin-bottom:-0.7rem;">Bonus Exp is gained in two ways:</h3> 
    
        <ol>
          <li style= "line-height:1.2rem; margin-bottom: 1rem;">By defeating teams that have a higher average level than yours. <br>
              Which is very useful for new players, but quickly becomes a rarity once you've got a leveled team yourself. <br>
              <span style="line-height:1.5rem;"> You gain this much: <code class="discord-code"> 600(avgEnemyLevel-avgAllyLevel) </code> </span>
          </li>
          <li>
            By reaching certain streak milestones! Which is where the real gains lie<owo-img style="width:1.5rem; margin-bottom: -0.3rem;">stonks</owo-img>. <br>
            Multiples of 10, 50, 100, 500 and 1000 give Bonus Exp: 
            <ul style="list-style: none; padding: 0.5rem 1rem 0.5rem 1rem;">
              <li><code class="discord-code">   10 </code> - <code class="discord-code"> 10√x + 500 </code></li>
              <li><code class="discord-code">   50 </code> - <code class="discord-code"> 30√x + 1500 </code></li>
              <li><code class="discord-code">  100 </code> - <code class="discord-code"> 50√x + 2500 </code></li>
              <li><code class="discord-code">  500 </code> - <code class="discord-code"> 100√x + 5000 </code></li>
              <li><code class="discord-code"> 1000 </code> - <code class="discord-code"> 250√x + 12500 </code></li>
              <li><span style="font-size:0.7rem;">The max is capped at 100k in these.</span></li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ol>

        <h3 style="margin-bottom:-0.7rem;margin-top:2rem;">Exp Multiplier</h3>
        <p>
          Pets on your <strong>primary</strong> team sometimes gain a multiplier on their battle Exp.  This happens when said pet is on a team with another pet of higher level— OwO then gives the lower leveled pet a multiplier for it to "catch up". You could also imagine it as your more experienced pet "training" the other. <br>
          The multiplier is equal to: <code class="discord-code"> (2 + .1 * levelDifference) </code>
        </p>

          <div class = "toolbar">

        <p style="margin-top:0"> Unsure how interesting this is, but here's the amount of Exp you get per hunt, depending on Gem Tier and Patreon status, but assuming there's no event, nor distorted: </p>

        </h2>
        <p>
          This ends up being the biggest contribution to leveling pets for the more inactive players.<br>
          At a maximum level of 200, the ⚔️ Exp trait provides 7000 Exp per hour. ( 168k /day )<br><br>

          Personally, for my team and situation, that's as much Exp as ~200 owoh & owob would give. So that's quite a big amount for most people.
