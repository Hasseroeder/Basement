  <p style= "margin-top:0; font-size:1rem;"> A rising resistance also produces a hyperbolic growth to your effective HP, but what does this actually mean? 
A pet with 500 HP & 50% PR could absorb 1000 points of physical damage, so we'd say it effectively has 1000 HP.
Now, imagining the same pet with 75% PR, it would have double the effective HP, despite just having a 25% increase in resistance. <br>
eHP values aren't the be-all and end-all, since there's also damage that avoids resistances, but they help a ton when comparing tanks with one another. 
In situations where one resistance is overwhelmingly more important than the other, we typically push said resistance-stat up to 3 to optimise eHP, but for more typical tanks, 2 for each is the default choice. <br><br>
We use this formula for the calculation: <code class="discord-code">   eHP = HP / (1 - Res)  </code>
