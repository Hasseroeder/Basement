    The NeonUtil utility bot has an incredibly useful streak estimation function (<code class="discord-code">neon global</code>).<br>
    I won't be going into how to use the command, because they've got a great guide in their support server, but I'll give some further recources that you can use to expand upon global's results. The common global gives you results in both; average Streak & Tierate, I'll talk about what you can do with these. <br><br>
    
    The chance of surviving your next battle is simply <code class="discord-code">1-1/Avg_Streak</code>, so your chance of surviving the next 500 battles would then simply be <code class="discord-code">(1-1/Avg_Streak)^500</code>.<br><br>
    If you turn this function around, you'll get the function for calculating the n-th percentile of your streak! And thus the median, which is honestly a more accurate depiction of a "normal" streak, rather than your average.<br>

      \textbf{P}_{50}(s)=\text{Median}(s)=\frac{\log\big(2\big)}{\log\big(\frac{s}{s-1}\big)}
    }

    We can also calculate your average streak Exp, even considering tierate!
