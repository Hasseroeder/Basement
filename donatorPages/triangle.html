        While there are only rough and vague categories of pets. <br>
        I'll still try to give a basic understanding of why we call pets a certain way.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>Tanks</strong> are pets based on tons of
        <owo-img style="width:1.2rem;margin-bottom:-0.2rem">HP</owo-img>Health and 
        <owo-img style="width:1.2rem;margin-bottom:-0.2rem">PR</owo-img><owo-img style="width:1.2rem;margin-bottom:-0.2rem; margin-left:-0.2rem">MR</owo-img>
        Resistances, doing as their name would suggest- tanking. 
    </p>
    <ul style="margin-left:-0.6rem; margin-top:-0.5rem; margin-right:2.5rem; line-height: 1.3rem;">
        
        <li>
            <owo-img style="width:1.2rem;margin-bottom:-0.2rem">lobbot</owo-img>
            <owo-img style="width:1.2rem;margin-bottom:-0.2rem">giraffbot</owo-img>
            <strong>Pure Tanks</strong> are the most extreme of tanks, allocating all their stats into HP,PR, and MR.<br>
            In current meta, they're commonly seen holding critically important weapons while being replenished with WP. 
        </li>
        <li style="margin-top: 0.3rem">
            <owo-img style="width:1.2rem;margin-bottom:-0.2rem">slothbot</owo-img>
            <owo-img style="width:1.2rem;margin-bottom:-0.2rem">dinobot</owo-img>
            <strong>WP Tanks</strong> are similar to pure tanks, with some added 
            <owo-img style="width:1.2rem;margin-bottom:-0.2rem">WP</owo-img>WP<br>
            On teams where you can't count on replenishment, choosing a pet with extra WP is the only way you can ensure reliable procs of your weapons. 
        </li>
        <li style="margin-top: 0.3rem">
            <owo-img style="width:1.2rem;margin-bottom:-0.2rem">gorilla</owo-img>
            <owo-img style="width:1.2rem;margin-bottom:-0.2rem">snail</owo-img>
            <strong>Hybrid Tanks</strong>, true to their name, are Hybrids of Attackers & Tanks, usually performing multipurpose roles. <br>

            <ul style="margin-left: -1rem;margin-top: 0.3rem;">
                <li style="margin-bottom: 0.15rem;">
                    A Gorilla with Shield for example, keeps <owo-img style="width:1rem;margin-bottom:-0.15rem">taunt</owo-img> taunting the enemy, and thus protects its team, but also attacks with its strength on off-turns. <br>
                </li>
                <li>
                    An Sstaff Snail in Pstall on the other hand, can tank quite a bit of damage and survive, while also using its Sstaff effectively.   
                </li>
            </ul>  
        </li>
    </ul>

    <p><strong>Attackers</strong> and <strong>Supporters</strong> are pets based mostly on 
        <owo-img style="width:1.2rem;margin-bottom:-0.2rem">STR</owo-img>Strength or 
        <owo-img style="width:1.2rem;margin-bottom:-0.2rem">MAG</owo-img>Magic, as these are the stats that their weapons act upon.<br>
    </p>
    <ul style="margin-left:-0.6rem; margin-top:-0.5rem; margin-right:2.5rem; line-height: 1.3rem;">
        <li style="list-style-type: none; margin:-0.6rem 0 -0.2rem; color:gray; font-size: 0.8rem;">
            # Attackers
        </li>
        <li>
            A pet holding a sword for example, deals damage based on it's strength, so it makes sense to maximise this stat as much as possible. 
            The same also applies to the magical side of pets too. <br>
        </li>
        <li style="list-style-type: none; margin-top: 0.3rem">
            And there's even attackers that have both high strength and magic, such as 
            <owo-img style="width:1.2rem;margin-bottom:-0.2rem">monkey</owo-img>Monkey! But these pets are usually considered quite useless, as the only weapons that can make use of such stats are 
            <owo-img style="width:1.2rem;margin-bottom:-0.2rem">rune</owo-img>Rune and 
            <owo-img style="width:1.2rem;margin-bottom:-0.2rem">lrune</owo-img>Lrune, which also work with normal strength or magical attackers.
        </li>
        <li style="list-style-type: none; margin: 0.3rem 0 -0.2rem; color:gray; font-size: 0.8rem;">
            # Supporters
        </li>
        <li>
            An attacker can always count on massive replenishment from <owo-img style="width:1.2rem;margin-bottom:-0.2rem">mtap</owo-img>, and even if that doesn't work, an attacker not acting is likely not going to end in a lost battle. <br>
            But if your healer suddenly stops acting, that could very quickly end up disastrous. So in similar logic to WP tanks, supporters have some added WP to ensure their acting, giving up some power in exchange. <br> 
            <ul style="margin-left:-1rem; margin-top: 0.3rem">
                <li>
                    <owo-img style="width:1.2rem;margin-bottom:-0.2rem;">MAG</owo-img>Magic-based supporters are commonly called Healers and Replenishers,
                </li>
                <li>
                    <owo-img style="width:1.2rem;margin-bottom:-0.2rem;">STR</owo-img>Strength-based supporters commonly hold buff and debuff weapons like Banner & Axe.

            <strong>Gems</strong> are pets with near zero, or zero stats in tankiness, and are usually considered the glass cannons of the game. 
        </li>
        <li style="margin-top: 0.3rem">
            <strong>Bots</strong> are pets with zeroed strength and magic, which makes them uniquely suited to tanking. <br>
            I've explained a little more above in <i>Effective Stats</i>.
